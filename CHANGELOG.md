# The initial v1.0.0 release!
Today marks the beginning. The beginning of my legacy. The first mod of [The Medium Suite](https://github.com/topics/the-medium-suite).
## Additions
- Ported over most of my code from [The-Incipisphere/Crops-N-Cogs-Core](https://github.com/The-Incipisphere/Crops-N-Cogs-Core) (which is now deprecated)
    - Features [a buttload of crops based on GT Materials](https://github.com/The-Incipisphere/Jades-Atrium/blob/84055a0480197475005a644c3838486675d05211/src/main/java/io/thedogofchaos/jadesatrium/common/data/ModPlants.java).
    - Also has anti-trample boots. Yknow, for if you get tired of accidentally trampling your crops.
        - In future, I may move this to its own INCREDIBLY tiny mod, just because it could be useful on its own.
    - Probably a couple more things that I forgot to mention.
## Notes
- ### Everything here is currently statically implemented. No adding stuff with KubeJS or datapacks yet.
    - I hope to change this soon.
- None of the crops have any crafting recipes for making the seeds or turning the harvested items into useful things.
    - This is because this mod is mainly intended for modpack developers like myself.
- The only textures for crops right now, are debug textures.
    - This will be changed when I get the skills to make more & better textures, or implement a system where people can define their own texture sets.
